# Pet-Adoption
## Description
* ## Overview 
    *   This was an exercise in JavaScript. We were given an array of "pets" which we needed to print to an empty div on our HTML. We also needed to add buttons which filtered through this array, and only printed pets with a certain value. We also needed a button to display all of the pets again.

* ## What I Learned
    * During this project I was able to better understand event  handlers, and “forEach” looping. I am starting to better understand the capability of functions, their value,and complexity.

    * I also used this project as a way to familiarize myself with CSS techniques a bit more. I was able to take the time to make this page compatible with mobile devices, and add effects to the buttons when clicked, and hovered over them. I am happy with the current styling, but am excited to learn what is possible when using both CSS, and JavaScript together.
